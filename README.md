## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- Node JS
- Express JS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- SCSS custom properties


### Continued development

While I feel a lot more comfortable using Node JS and MongoDB to store my data. I feel like I should try using them in a lot more complex project to feel like I completely understood the concept.
