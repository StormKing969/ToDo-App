## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- Node JS
- Express JS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- SCSS custom properties


### Continued development

While I feel a lot more comfortable using Node JS and MongoDB to store my data. I feel like I should try using them in a lot more complex project to feel like I completely understood the concept.

### Useful resources

- [Custom Checkbox](https://dev.to/kunaal438/checkbox-css-style-gradient-checkbox-with-pure-css-custom-input-css-3gko) - This helped me create the rounded checkbox and also add a linear gradient.
